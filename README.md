# Console-Based-Game
A console-based game programmed in Java. Made during Grade 11.

Limitations:
I deliberately chose not to fix these limitations, to show my inexperience back in Grade 11. After first year at UBC, I now know how to make my programs more robust and refactor repetitive code.

- When playing **Guess the mine**, entering a coordinate outside of the given minefield throws an uncaught exception, causing the game to end.
- When asked to exit a minigame or not, if and only if user inputs "yes", "YES", "y", or "Y", the program leaves the minigame and returns to the main menu. Any other input starts another round of said minigame.
